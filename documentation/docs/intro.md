# Welcome to the ChromOptimise wiki!

ChromOptimise is a pipeline that identifies the optimum number of states that
should be used with
[ChromHMM](https://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/#:~:text=ChromHMM%20is%20software%20for%20learning,and%20spatial%20patterns%20of%20marks.)'s
`LearnModel` command for a particular genomic dataset.

For a quickstart guide, please consult the
[README](https://github.com/sof202/ChromOptimise) on the GitHub page.

This wiki contains further information about the pipeline, including how to set
up the configuration files, example usage, pipeline explanation, expected
memory usage, processing times and more. To get started, click on the
'documentation' navigation bar at the top of this page.
