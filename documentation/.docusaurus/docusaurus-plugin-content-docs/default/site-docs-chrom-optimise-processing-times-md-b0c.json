  "description": "SLURM workload manager has the feature of introducing a maximum wall time into each script. The default maximum wall time is set in the #SBATCH section of each script and can be overridden when setting the --time option when using sbatch. If the time of execution for a script exceeds this maximum wall time, it will terminate early. This is useful as it helps with workload management on HPCs that a large number of users have access to, and also reduces the effects of non-halting programs.",
